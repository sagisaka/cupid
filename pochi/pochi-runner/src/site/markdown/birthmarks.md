# Birthmarks

## Birthmarks

The goal of software birthmark is to detect the copied programs.
A software birthmark is a set of characteristics extracted from a program.

#### Definition 1. Birthmarks

Let *p* be a program and *f* be a method to extract a set of characteristics from *p*.
We say *f(p)* is a birthmark of *p* iff both of the following conditions are satisfied.

* *f(p)* is obtained only from *p* itself, and
* Program *q* is a copy of *p*, then *f(p) = f(q)*.

## Types of birthmarks

Birthmarks are classified into three types by the extraction methods.

### Static birthmarks

### Dynamic birthmarks

### Thread-oblivious birthmarks
